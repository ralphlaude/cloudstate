   * Decision logs.
   *
   * For handleStreamedIn there are two options how to deal with the incoming Akka Source of commands.
   * The first option is run the Akka Source and pass those commands to the User function.
   * The second option is to pass the Akka Source to the User Function and it runs it. I found this very cumbersome
   * on the one hand for the usability because the User Function needs to know how to execute Akka Streams.
   * On the other hand for executing Akka Streams Akka Materializer should be passed around in the CommandContext,
   * this way the proxy is somehow exposed to the User Function.
   * I take the second option this the proxy does the heavy lifting for the Akka Streams and provides the User Function
   * with the right inputs.
   *
   * For all this the io.cloudstate.javasupport.impl.ReflectionHelper was extended to deal with types like
   * java.util.List (method handleStreamedIn) and akka.stream.javadsl.Source (method handleStreamedOut)
   * which are the input and output type of a Stateless User Function. Some invokeXXX methods are added to deal with that.
   *
   *
   * Command Id is still missing in FunctionCommand. This lead to the fact that it is not possible right now
   * to create a FunctionReply.Response.Failure. FunctionReply.Response.Failure needs a command id.
   * The proxy cannot map a Failure to originating FunctionCommand. This is already known as problem.
   * The more general question is how the proxy should generate command id for Stateless FunctionCommand.
   * I see a transient and persistent way for creating command id. The transient way can use an in memory randomizer
   * for that. The persistent way can use an Event Sourced Entity to deal with.
